        </h2>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-custom-color-4 u-text-default u-text-3">AI (artificial intelligence) is intelligence demonstrated by
machines. This technology often revolves around the use of algorithms, which
are coded by humans. In terms of machine learning, this technology is a branch
in collecting algorithms that the AI learned. Machine learning helps to input
data into the computer, which helps it learn algorithms fast. Machine learning
focuses on the development of computer programs. AI and machine learning are
almost combined with each other in every case. The state of art of those new
technologies is very useful for humans to complete the job and others' basic
activities in life, such as driving cars. It automates every step of the
algorithms to run everything as smoothly as possible since it is coded and
being taught day by day by the scientist about how to handle problems.&nbsp; In detail, it can be coded to think and act
like a human. For instance, the self-driving car applied by the AI will
automatically avoid an object on the road by turning left or right, which is
similar to the thought of a driver. By collecting a tuple of driving habits and
skills, artificial intelligence is gradually grown up with data, which makes it
more intelligent in handle the situation on the road. This intelligence may
surpass the human ability in analyzing and reflecting as a situation can be
analyzed and handled in a millisecond.</p>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-custom-color-4 u-text-default u-text-3">AI and machine learning have offered humans an array of benefits
related to work and lifestyle. Firstly, they offer people automation in a
myriad of aspects such as a self-driving car, automatic shops and smart home,
which facilitates people to save time and money. Thanks to AI, a lot of
companies have made a great deal of revenue, which directly contributes to the
social economics. Furthermore, AI and machine learning have made a milestone in
medical aspects as they may replace the doctor to use the scalpel in small
operations. With this coded intelligence, the percentage of risks and errors
will be minimized, which maximizes the survival rate of the patients. In addition,
AI and machine learning can offer the research and data analysis function that
can help users to analyze the data, which is very useful as the data input is
very big.</p>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-custom-color-4 u-text-default u-text-3">In the next three years, AI and machine learning are expected to be
expanded deeper to more fields such as medical, education, transportation, and
economics. They are hoped to be more intelligent in specific aspects. A clear
illustration of this is that in the following three years, they may have the
ability to do the whole operation or diagnosis without the disruption of
humans, which can save a great deal of labor force, time, and money for not
only the hospitals but also the patients. Another example is that AI may have
the ability to teach students what it has learned from humans by applying
artificial voices and voice recognition to listen and feedback to the students’
questions. If we can handle that, we will save a great amount of time and money
for the students. Furthermore, AI and machine learning are expected to be
globally used in the next three years, which can make the life of people all
around the world better.</p>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-custom-color-4 u-text-default u-text-3">To this end, AI and machine learning need some technological and
developments which can be provided by humans. Firstly, AI and machine learning
are based on algorithms, which are built by humans. Therefore, people should
develop the algorithms strongly and detailly for the AI to learn and know how
to handle every case. Besides, AI and machine learning should be equipped with
emotion recognition functions, which helps them know how to treat people based
on their current mood. To complete this, there must be a disruption of humans,
who can deeply understand the emotion.</p>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-custom-color-4 u-text-default u-text-3">AI
and machine learning are changing the game in every market, which is the
potential impact of this development. Those technologies have significantly
contributed to global economics. A clear illustration of this is that Middle
East Asia has earned 320 billion dollars thanks to this technology development.
Furthermore, those modern technologies will bring change in our daily habits.
Firstly, it will change how people complete basic tasks such as a driving car
or opening a house door as self-driving technology and voice recognition are
widely applied. For instance, we are currently opening the door by pushing physically.
However, in the future, all the door is equipped with voice recognition
technology, which requires our speech to open and close.</p>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-custom-color-4 u-text-default u-text-3">In the future, thanks to the burgeoning development of AI and
machine learning, humans will be more comfortable in controlling their life.
For instance, there may be some programs that advise people what to do in
different daily cases. Those programs act as a supervisor, which navigates the
lifestyle and habits of humans. In addition, the way how we make transactions will
be radically changed. Technologies related to AI and machine learning, such as
voice recognition, will be ubiquitously used in supermarkets and grocery
stores, which speeds up the selling progress. For example, customers in the
future just need to come to the store, speak out about what they want to buy,
and then choose payment options before getting the goods.</p>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-custom-color-4 u-text-default u-text-3">Generally, the whole society will adapt to living with AI and
machine learning. However, low-tech people will be influenced more significant
as they have to change a lot to adapt to the technology age, which is opposite
to high- tech people who are already known how to use some basic technologies.
Moreover, children and teenagers are potentially affected by those technologies
since these generations are easy to adapt to new things and not as conservative
as the elderly. They will master those technologies and make them their useful
sidekick in the future where people and technologies such as AI and machine
learning are inseparable.</p>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-custom-color-4 u-text-default u-text-3">On the one hand, AI and machine learning help people in a lot of
fields, which increases safety and welfare for humans in tandem with decreasing
risks for them. On the other hand, they may cause some drawbacks for humans in
employment and jobs. In the future, those technologies may dominate humans in a
myriad of tasks, which gradually push many people to the verge of unemployment.
A clear illustration of this is that AI and machine learning will be widely
used in education fields such as teaching. Therefore, an array of teachers will
be replaced by those kinds of technologies, which take their work in the
future. Another superb example is the doctor work, which must be done precisely
and safely for the patients. This hazard work requires high precision, in which
AI and machine learning can surpass doctors. Gradually, most doctors will be
replaced by those technologies.</p>

affect me as I love studying and using advanced technologies. In detail, they
may change my learning style as they may provide numerous useful functions. For
instance, AI and machine learning may offer me an AI sidekick in computer in
which I can make questions and study together for improvement. This sidekick
use voice recognition and data analysis to communicate with me and give support
when I get into academic trouble. Besides, it may change some of my habits,
such as come out and come in the home. In detail, I will apply AI and machine
learning to my house so that I just make commands such as “Lock the door” while
coming out or “Open the door” when I come back.</p>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-custom-color-4 u-text-default u-text-3">Once
AI and machine learning are dominated, my life will be totally different. I
will have to spend more money to afford new technologies to catch the trend and
earn more useful functions. However, this may be very beneficial as I will save
a lot of time thanks to the assistance of AI and machine learning. For example,
I can have breakfast on the self-driving motorbike and come to class on time,
which is impossible now since I cannot ride the motorbike in tandem with having
breakfast. Furthermore, all the construction will also be different as they are
equipped with face recognition, which limitedly allows people to enter if they
have no permission. This will save a lot of time for students and officers who
do not have much time to spend for a hard-working day</p>

revolution. There will be differences in the effect on each generation.
Firstly, my grandmother and grandfather will be most affected as they do not
know much about technology. Therefore, I may have to instruct them on how to
use those kinds of technologies as it is not too hard to use. Next, my parents
will also be slightly affected, but they will quickly adapt to AI and machine
learning as they have some exposure to those kinds of technologies in their
companies. Thus, they can learn them easily. My brother and sister will not
face any challenge in adapting those technologies as they are all teenagers who
are very flexible and adaptive.</p>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-custom-color-1 u-text-default u-text-3">In recent years, AI and machine learning have developed dynamically
to help people complete hazard tasks. People need some kinds of machines with
constructions created by people that can replace people to execute challenging
tasks as there may be a lot of dangerous problems during the progress. This
demand gradually leads to the appearance of robots, which can be replaced by
people in some aspects of work. The state of the art of this technology is the
amazing fact that a machine can execute precisely the command coded by people.
This will facilitate the progress of work as people now have a useful sidekick
to help by making the demand.</p>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-custom-color-1 u-text-default u-text-3">Currently, the development of robots provides people an array of
benefits. Firstly, robots can replace people in numerous situations that need
high precision and consistency. A clear illustration of this is that the
package task of thousands of people in a factory can be replaced by one or two
robots that can complete tasks by executing the codes of developers.
Furthermore, robots can help people to save a great amount of time as it can do
multi-tasks based on the design of people. Moreover, robots with advanced
development combined with other technologies such as AI and machine learning
can act like people, such as humanoid robots. Humanoid robots are able to
communicate with people by being applied to other advanced technology. A superb
example of this is that Sophia, the most developed humanoid robot, can be
considered as a citizen as this robot has emotions, thinking, and locomotion.
In detail, it can discuss with people about an academic issue with some basic
body languages or dance in a suitable situation. This development has proved
what can be done by robots.</p>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-custom-color-1 u-text-default u-text-3">Potentially, robots will interrupt many fields in the lifestyle of
people, namely work, home, education, security, employment, health,
transportation, and entertainment. In terms of education, robots may be widely
used in school and university where the demand of one on one support is very
high. In the next three years, the robots can also assist people in health
service. They may replace the surgeon doctor to surpass the operations, which
required a myriad of skills and concentration to do well. This will reduce the
stress put on the doctors, who can be affected by stressful emotions leading to
the failure of the operation. Besides, robots can also provide an entertainment
service for people. For instance, they can sing the users’ favorite songs,
dance, or even talk or tell them jokes. In addition, robots can create jobs for
humans. As robots need code and maintenances to run smoothly, it will
indirectly create works such as robot maintainers and developers for people as
the demand is highly required.</p>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-custom-color-1 u-text-default u-text-3">As
mentioned above, the actions of robots can be coded by humans. However, there
must be a combination with other technologies to optimize the efficiency of
robots. Two remarkable technologies are artificial intelligence and machine
learning. Those two technologies will input a lot of data for the robots to
learn and gradually have the ability to handle lots of different situations,
which progressively leads the robots to the peak of perfection. Another
important technology is cyber security applying to robots. This technology is
essential to prevent the robots from being hacked, which is extremely dangerous
as once being hacked, robots will be out of control and can cause a lot of
damage for people. A clear example of this is that killer robots, which is
developed by the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW), have been lost
control once. It destroyed numerous constructions in the building and killed
some people. Therefore, security in robots must be applied to protect the
safety of the scientist as well as other people.</p>

in various aspects of life, which makes their life more comfortable. It may be
a potential revolution as it affects the mindset of people in doing simple
tasks. For instance, when current people want to produce a candy production
line, they will think of hiring fifty employees to do this. However, in the
future, they may think of hiring a robot from providers to save time and money
as well as enhance efficiency.</p>

crowded with robots, who are ready to give support to people. The world will
radically change thanks to the ubiquitous usage of robots. A superb example of
this is that androids with the application of AI and IoT will be able to
recognize the face and define people with their features and characters and
choose the suitable ways to communicate and help them if necessary.
Furthermore, they will be considered as a must-have item in each family and
company similar to furniture.</p>

influence level. Firstly, the young generation, including children and
teenagers, will be slightly affected as they are very flexible. They will
easily adapt to new changes as their mind are quite opened. They will be able to
master using robots in a short period of time. While in the middle generations,
it will take a bit longer to get used to using robots as their daily habit as
they can learn some basic commands, which is enough for their demand. The most
challenging generation is the elderly as they are low- tech people who are not
flexible to adopt new technology in their life. They will struggle to use
robots hard since they do not believe in those humanoid robots.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
